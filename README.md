# knn-recommender
A pure JavaScript implementation of a K-nearest neighbour based collaborative filtering recommender for like/dislike user item matrices. This library should run both in node and browser environments. This is an exprimental implementation. If you are looking for a more high performing library, I'd recommend you to check out [recommendationRacoon](https://github.com/guymorita/recommendationRaccoon).

The recommender takes a user item matrix of size X x Y where X[0] column represents the user id's and Y[0] the item labels. The cells in the matrix are expected to contain either -1 (dislike), 0 (no rating given) or 1 (like). This information can be used to calculate the similarity of users in the matrix based on jaccard similarity.

Example of a possible user item matrix:
```
[
    ['emptycorner', 'item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3', 'item 4',
        'item 5', 'item 6', 'item 7'],
    ['user 1', 1, -1, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0],
    ['user 2', 1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0]
]
```

Jaccard similarity calculates the common ratings between two users and divides that by the total ratings given by the users. The non-ratings are not considered when calculating the similarity of two users.

So if user X has a rating matrix (1, -1, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0) and Y (1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0) their Jaccard similarity is (1+1+1) / 5 = 3/5. 5 is effectively the number of the elements that at least one of the two users has either liked or disliked. Based on this we could provide a recommendation for user Y for item number 6 as Y hasn't expressed any preference for that and X has liked this item.

This recommender can also work only based on non recommendations and recommendations (0's and 1's so it's not necessary to provide dislikes (-1).

# Basic usage

```js
const kNNRecommender = new KNNRecommender([['emptycorner', 'item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3', 'item 4','item 5', 'item 6', 'item 7'], ['user 1', 1, -1, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0], ['user 2', 1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0]])
kNNRecommender.initializeRecommender().then(() => {
    const userRecommendations = kNNRecommender.generateNNewUniqueRecommendationsForUserId('user 2')
    console.log(`new recommendation for user 2 ${userRecommendations[0].itemId}`)

Method             | Arguments          | Returns      | Description                      | Example  
------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|------------  
KNNRecommender | ```userItemMatrix: Array<Array<string or number>> orÂ null ```| void | This constructor takes a X x Y user item matrix as its argument. X[0] column represents the user id's and Y[0] the item labels. The cells in the matrix are expected to contain either -1 (dislike), 0 (no rating given) or 1 (like). The matrix can be null and you can use the addNewItemToDataset anda addNewUserToDataset methods for initializing the matrix | ```const kNNRecommender = new KNNRecommender([['emptycorner', 'item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3', 'item 4','item 5', 'item 6', 'item 7'], ['user 1', 1, -1, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0], ['user 2', 1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0]]) ```
initializeRecommender | no arguments | ``` Promise<boolean> ``` | Initializes the recommender based on the provided user item matrix so we can start asking recommendations from it. If you add new items or users to the matrix and want the updates to affect the recommendations, you need to run this initialization again. This initialization is a heavy (roughly: O(n^3) + O(n * log(n)) operation. The method returns a Promise that resolves to true when the initialization is completed succesfully. | ```kNNRecommender.initializeRecommender().then(() => {... ```
generateNNewRecommendationsForUserId | ```userId: string, amountOfDesiredNewRecommendations: number = 1, amountOfDesiredNearestNeighboursToUse: number = 3 ``` | ``` Array<Recommendation> ``` | Try to generate the desired amount of new recommendations for a user based on what similar users have liked. The method starts with the most similar user and collects all the likings from him/her where the current user hasn't expressed their preference yet. If the amount of desired recommendations hasn't been fulfilled yet, it proceededs to the second most similar user and so on. The method might add the same recommendation twice if an item has been recommended by several similar users. If you want to have these potential multi recommendations exluded use the method generateNNewUniqueRecommendationsForUserId instead. Returns an array containing the recommendations or an empty array if no recommendations can be generated from the data e.g. ```[{itemId: 'item 1', recommenderUserId: 'user 3', similarityWithRecommender: 0.6}, {itemId: 'item 1', recommenderUserId: 'user 2', similarityWithRecommender: 0.4} {itemId: 'item 3', recommenderUserId: 'user 2', similarityWithRecommender: 0.4}, null] ``` | ```const userRecommendations = kNNRecommender.generateNNewRecommendationsForUserId('user 3', 2, 3); console.log(`${userRecommendations[0].itemId} ${userRecommendations[0].recommenderUserId} {userRecommendations[0].similarityWithRecommender}`)```
generateNNewUniqueRecommendationsForUserId | ```userId: string, amountOfDesiredNewRecommendations: number = 1, amountOfDesiredNearestNeighboursToUse: number = 3 ``` | ``` Array<Recommendation> ``` | Try to generate the desired amount of new recommendations for a user based on what similar users have liked. The method starts with the most similar user and collects all the likings from him/her where the current user hasn't expressed their preference yet. If the amount of desired recommendations hasn't been fulfilled yet, it proceededs to the second most similar user and so on. The method doesn't add same recommendation twice even if it would be recommended by several users. If you want to have these potential multi recommendations included use the method generateNNewRecommendationsForUserId instead. Returns an array containing the recommendations or an empty array if no recommendations can be generated from the data e.g. ```[{itemId: 'item 1', recommenderUserId: 'user 3', similarityWithRecommender: 0.6}, itemId: 'item 3', recommenderUserId: 'user 2', similarityWithRecommender: 0.4}, null] ``` | ```const userRecommendations = kNNRecommender.generateNNewUniqueRecommendationsForUserId('user 3', 2, 3); console.log(`${userRecommendations[0].itemId} ${userRecommendations[0].recommenderUserId} {userRecommendations[0].similarityWithRecommender}`)```
getNNearestNeighboursForUserId | ```userId: string, amountOfDesiredNeighbours: number = -1 ``` | ``` Array<UserSimilarity> ``` | Returns a sorted list of the n most similar users to the given userId. The elements in the list contain objects in the form {otherUserId, similarity}. E.g. ```[{otherUserId: 'User 2', similarity: 0.53}, {otherUserId: 'User 3', similarity: 0.4}] ```| ```  const user1ToOtherUsersArray = kNNRecommender.getNNearestNeighboursForUserId('user 1')```
getAllRecommendationsForUserId | ```userId: string ``` | ``` Array<string or number> ``` | Get all the recommendations for certain user id. You can use this method together with getNNearestNeighboursForUserId to manually generate recommendations for one user based on the recommedations of other users. Returns e.g. ```['user 1', 1, 0, -1, 0]``` | ```  const allUserRecommendations = kNNRecommender.getAllRecommendationsForUserId('user 1')```
addLikeForUserToAnItem | ```userId: string, itemId: string ``` | void | Update the liking value for a certain user and item. NOTE: This method does not invoke an automatic recalculation of the user similarities. You need to tricker that manually if you wish by running initializeRecommender-method | ```kNNRecommender.addLikeForUserToAnItem('user 1', 'item 2')```
addDislikeForUserToAnItem | ```userId: string, itemId: string ``` | void | Update the disliking value for a certain user and item. NOTE: This method does not invoke an automatic recalculation of the user similarities. You need to tricker that manually if you wish by running initializeRecommender-method | ```kNNRecommender.addDislikeForUserToAnItem('user 1', 'item 2')```
addNewUserToDataset | ```userRow: Array<string or number>``` | void | Add a new user row to the data set. NOTE: This method does not invoke an automatic recalculation of the user similarities. You need to tricker that manually if you wish by running initializeRecommender-method. | ```kNNRecommender.addNewUserToDataset(['user x', 1, 0, -1, ...])```
addNewEmptyUserToDataset | ```userId: string``` | void | Convenience method to add an empty user to data set with only user id. All the recommendations are initialized with 0. NOTE: This method does not invoke an automatic recalculation of the user similarities. You need to tricker that manually if you wish by running initializeRecommender-method. | ```kNNRecommender.addNewEmptyUserToDataset('user 3')```
addNewItemToDataset | ```itemId: string``` | void | Add a new item to the user item matrix and initalize all user recommendations with value 0 for the new item. NOTE: This method does not invoke an automatic recalculation of the user similarities. You need to tricker that manually if you wish by running initializeRecommender-method | ```kNNRecommender.addNewItemToDataset('item 8')```


# Performance

Performance tests were run on a 2014 Macbook Pro with a 2,2 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 processor and 16 GM 1600 MHZ DDR3 memory.

Initialization times with different size matrices were as listed here:

Matrix size (users x items)      | Initialization time
------------------|---------------
100 x 100 | 40ms 
500 x 500 | 500ms 
1000 x 1000 | 23s
1000 x 50 | 1.2s
50 x 1000 | 80ms
50 x 10000 | 0.5s

Adding more users raises the initialization times radically. So if you find a way to divide your users into clusters, you can reduce the amount of user rows needed for providing recommendations for a certain user and thus provide recommendations faster.
